TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript. TypeScript is JavaScript with additional syntax in order to add the type system to JavaScript. TypeScript uses a compiler that is run in your CLI.

#### The TS Type System

- To help catch errors _during development_. The TypeScript complier can catch errors during development and will display errors in the console if errors are detected. 
- The TypeScript compiler is going to use something called type annotations to analyze our code base. Developers are responsible for adding in these type annotations. Type annotations are similar to comments that describe the purpose of our code or the information that is flowing through our program.
- The type system is only active during developement. TypeScript is compiled into JavaScript.

For a quick demo, you can always checkout [this](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/) website for a browser typescript compiler.
