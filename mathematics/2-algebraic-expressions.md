### **Writing Algebraic Expressions**

To solve algebra problems, you will need to be able to translate number relationships described in words into algebraic expressions.

| Algebraic Expression in Words              | In Symbols    | 
| ----------------------------------         |:-------------:| 
| the product of 5 and a number              | 5x            | 
| a number decreased by 12                   | x - 12        | 
| the sum of 3 and the square of a number    | 3 + x^2       | 
| 6 less than the quotient of a number and 2 | x/2 - 6       |
| one hald a number increased by 15          | 1/2x + 15     |
| 4 times the difference of -3 and a number  | 4(-3 - x)     |
| a number less another number               | x - y         |
| 10 less the square root of a number plus 3 | 10- sqrt(x + 3) |

### **Simplifying and Evaluating Expressions**

Simplifying an expression means to perform all the operations you can within an expression.

A __term__ is a number, a variable, or the product or quotient of numbers and variables. A term cannot include a sum or a difference.

Examples:

```
5x    3y^2    13    x^3    x/2
```

__Like terms__ have the same variable raised to the same power. For example, 3x^2 and 5x^2 are like terms. However, 6x and 2x^2 are not like terms.

Example: Simplify 2x - 5 + 4x^2 - 8 + 6x

```
= 2x - 5 + 4x^2 - 8 + 6x
= (2x + 6x) + (-5 + -8) + 4x^2
= 8x + (-13) + 4x^2
= 4x^2 + 8x - 13
```

The __distributive property__ allows you to remove grouping symbols to simplify expressions. 

```
a(b + c) = ab + ac
```

Example: Simplify 4x - 3(x + 9) + 15

```
= 4x - 3(x + 9) + 15
= 4x + -3(x + 9) + 15
= 4x + (-3x) + (-3)(9) + 15
= 4x + (-3x) + (-27) + 15
= (4x - 3x) + (-27 + 15)
= x - 12
```
