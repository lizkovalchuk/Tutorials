### **Introduction**

#### What is Unit Testing

Unit testing is testing individual units of code. A unit is the smalled testable part of code, like a function. To unit test, we are often isolating the dependencies and test that the output is what you exepct. 

#### Why do we Unit Test?

- It builds trust when we refactor code.
- When we make changes to our code, we have automated tests ready to go.
- Code that can be tested, is the best code. Good code can be tested.
- Code changes quickly, can unit tests will speed up output in agile environments.
- It documents your code (helps when projects are passed to other developers). Unit tests document:
    - how the function is consumed
    - how the params are passed
    - how the response is parsed
- With the Jasmine Test Framework, it's possible to automate testing

#### Why Jasmine?
    
- Jasmine comes ready "out-of-the-box"
- Jasmine comes with spies, matchers and other needed testing features.
