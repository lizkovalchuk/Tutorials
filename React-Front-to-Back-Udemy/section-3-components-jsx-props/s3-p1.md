### **_Intro_**

Think of websites are built with components, and components nested in other components. Components have properties and states. Think of state as data attached to that component. 

* Smart Components has state that changes.
* Dumb Components is more static, it's going to be the same on every page.

With *Dumb Components*, you can use a single function, in order words, "stateless functional components". *Smart components* has a state, so the need to be a class. In most cases you're going to need to share state between components. 

When we have nested components, we can pass state down with props.

### **_JSX_**

JSX is a javascript extension that allows us to put HTML into javascript. Some rules:
* Cannot use the ```class``` attribute, you need to use ```className```.
* Cannot use the ```for``` attribute, commonly used in the ```label``` element. Instead use ```htmlFor```.
* When you return, always return a single parent element. For example, you cannot return the following:

```javascript
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>The App Component</h1>
      </div>
      // <div>
      //   <h1>Can't have 2 parent elements</h1>
      // </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### **_JSX Expressions_**

Inside the ```.render``` function, we can put any kind of javascript that we want for conditions (and other stuff like that) above the ```return```. The ```return``` should only be JSX, so don't define variables or do any logic inside the return.

```javascript
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    const name = 'Larry'; 
    
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>The App Component</h1>
        <h4>Hello {name.toUpperCase()}</h4>
        <h4>1 + 1 = { 1 + 1 }</h4>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
Any javascript expression can go withing curly braces (```{}```) withing the return. You can do other javascript expression like arithmatic with the curly braces as well. 

Conditional logic can be set within the component as seen below.
```javascript
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    const name = 'Larry'; 
    const showHello = true;
  
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>The App Component</h1>
        {showHello ?  <h4>Hello {name.toUpperCase()}</h4> : null}
        <h4>1 + 1 = { 1 + 1 }</h4>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

In a more real world situation you're probably not going to be creating variables like the above. Most dynamic variables will bt coming from states and props. 

Another approach is to put pieces of JSX into variables. 

```javascript
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    const name = 'Larry'; 
    const showHello = true;
    const showMath = true;
    const num1 = 40;
    const num2 = 23;
  
    let math;
    if(showMath){
      math = (
       <h4>
        {num1} + {num2} = { num1 + num2 }
      </h4>
      );   
    } else {
      math = null;
    }
  
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>The App Component</h1>
        {showHello ?  <h4>Hello {name.toUpperCase()}</h4> : null}
        {math}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
