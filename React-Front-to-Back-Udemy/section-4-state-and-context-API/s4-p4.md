### **_Context API_**

The Context API allows us to have a single place were we can have our application state so that we don't need to propogate properties upwards. That way we can access states from any component.

Here are the steps to create a Context API.

1. Create a file outside of your components folder and we are naming it `context.js`. This file will act like a provider and all of our other components will be wrapped in our provider component.
2. `context.js` will use a React core function called `createContext`

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

const Context = React.createContext();

export class Provider extends Component {}
```

3. Next, copy the hardcoded state that we have in `Contacts.js` and move it to `context.js`. This will create a global state.
4. `context.js` needs a `render()` method as well. Inside `render()` is where we will return `Context` with a core method of `Provider` (add this method with dot notation).
5. You can pass properties from `<Context.Provider>` through a `value` attribute. (This is how we can pass anything that we want to make available throughout our application.)
6. Inside `<Context.Provider>` you will need to add `{this.props.children}`.
7. Lastly you need to export what's called the `Consumer`. We can then use the `Consumer` within any component that we want to access global state from.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

const Context = React.createContext();

export class Provider extends Component {
  state = {
    contacts: [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: "John Doe",
        email: "jdoe@gmail.com",
        phone: "555-555-5555"
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        name: "Karen Williams",
        email: "karen@gmail.com",
        phone: "222-222-2222"
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        name: "Henry Johnson",
        email: "henry@gmail.com",
        phone: "111-111-1111"
      }
    ]
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <context.Provider value={this.state}>
        {this.props.children}
      </context.Provider>
    );
  }
}

export const Consumer = Context.Consumer;
```

8. After you've exported `Consumer`, you need to go to `App.js`. There will you will need `import { Provider } from './context';`.
9. Wrap everything `<div className="App">` in `<Provider>`.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import Contacts from "./components/Contacts";
import Header from "./components/Header";

import { Provider } from "./context";

import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
import "./App.css";

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Provider>
        <div className="App">
          <Header branding="Contact Manager" />
          <div className="container">{<Contacts />}</div>
        </div>
      </Provider>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

10. Next, go to the component that actually needs to use the context, which in our case is our `Contacts.js` file. There we will need to import that `Consumer` we created in `context.js`.
11. Once it's imported, we will need to adjust were we get `const { contacts } = this.state;` from.

    - Here is `Contacts.js` _before_ we update `const { contacts } = this.state;` (the code below is still getting state from itself, however, don't forget that we already moved the hardcoded state from this file to `context.js`):

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import Contact from "./Contact";
import { Consumer } from "../context";

class Contacts extends Component {
  deleteContact = id => {
    const { contacts } = this.state;
    const newContacts = contacts.filter(contact => contact.id !== id);
    this.setState({
      contacts: newContacts
    });
  };

  render() {
    const { contacts } = this.state;
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        {contacts.map(contact => (
          <Contact
            key={contact.id}
            contact={contact}
            deleteClickHandler={this.deleteContact.bind(this, contact.id)}
          />
        ))}
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
}

export default Contacts;
```

 - - Here is `Contacts.js` _after_ we've updated `const { contacts } = this.state;` from getting state from itself to getting the state from `Consumer`:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import Contact from "./Contact";
import { Consumer } from "../context";

class Contacts extends Component {
  deleteContact = id => {
    const { contacts } = this.state;
    const newContacts = contacts.filter(contact => contact.id !== id);
    this.setState({
      contacts: newContacts
    });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <Consumer>
        {value => {
          const { contacts } = value;
          return (
            <React.Fragment>
              {contacts.map(contact => (
                <Contact
                  key={contact.id}
                  contact={contact}
                  deleteClickHandler={this.deleteContact.bind(this, contact.id)}
                />
              ))}
            </React.Fragment>
          );
        }}
      </Consumer>
    );
  }
}

export default Contacts;
```

Note that `value` (the first item inside `<Consumer>`) is getting its value from the value attribute (it looks like an attribute but it's actually a property) that is being set in `context.js` as seen here:

```jsx
  render() {
    return (
      <context.Provider value={this.state}>
        {this.props.children}
      </context.Provider>
    );
  }
```

This still isn't quite working as it was before because `deleteClickHandler={this.deleteContact.bind(this, contact.id)` is using `this` which is no longer the case.

### **_Reducer Function_**

In order to fix the delete functionality we had before, we need to create a reducer with actions. The actions will basically be functions that manipulate the state and the reducer will basically create the effects of what we do. So in our case, we need an action to delete and then a reducer to output the result. The best way to do this is to create actions in `context.js` that we can access from anywhere.

1. Delete `deleteClickHandler` from both your `<React.Fragment>` as well as the function at the top of your `<Contacts>` component. The result should be:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import Contact from "./Contact";
import { Consumer } from "../context";

class Contacts extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Consumer>
        {value => {
          const { contacts } = value;
          return (
            <React.Fragment>
              {contacts.map(contact => (
                <Contact key={contact.id} contact={contact} />
              ))}
            </React.Fragment>
          );
        }}
      </Consumer>
    );
  }
}

export default Contacts;
```

2. You will also need to remove the `onDeleteClick` property from `Contact.js` as well.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import propTypes from "prop-types";

class Contact extends Component {
  state = {
    showContactInfo: true
  };

  onDeleteClick = () => {
    // this.props.deleteClickHandler();  DELETE THIS LINE
  };

  render() {
    const { name, email, phone } = this.props.contact;
    const { showContactInfo } = this.state;

    return (
      <div className="card card-body mb-3">
        <h4>
          {name}
          <i
            onClick={() =>
              this.setState({ showContactInfo: !this.state.showContactInfo })
            }
            className="fas fa-sort-down"
            style={{ cursor: "pointer" }}
          />
          <i
            className="fas fa-times"
            style={{ cursor: "pointer", float: "right", color: "red" }}
            onClick={this.onDeleteClick}
          />
        </h4>
        {showContactInfo ? (
          <ul className="list-group">
            <li className="list-group-item">Email: {email}</li>
            <li className="list-group-item">Phone: {phone}</li>
          </ul>
        ) : null}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

Contact.propTypes = {
  contact: propTypes.object.isRequired
  // deleteClickHandler: propTypes.func.isRequired DELETE THIS LINE AS WELL
};

export default Contact;
```

- - We still need the function `onDeleteClick` attached to our delete icon. Though instead of altering the state within the `Contact.js` component, which is how it has been working so far, we need to attach `onDeleteClick` with `context.js`, as we need to affect the state in there.

3. Create what's called a reducer in `context.js`. Above your `Provider` class, create a const function called `reducer` which takes 2 paramters, one for `state` and the other for `action`.
4. The second parameter `action` will take in an object which will be of a certain type. That type is what we want to evaluate to figure out what we're going to be doing. We could use an `if/else` statement, though the instructor recommends a `switch`. (Furthermore that is how it's done in Redux.)
5. Inside the `switch` statement, we are going to want to evaluate the type, and since we are passing an object to the second parameter of `action` in `reducer`, we use dot notation to access the `type`. The `type` will be a capatilized string.
6. In your `switch` statement, create a case for `DELETE_CONTACT`. If that case passes, return the state with the deleted contact which you identify by `id` with `filter()`. Use the spread operator to make a copy of the immutable state.
7. To pass the `id`, you need to use another property of the `action` object which is `payload`. We will have to pass the `id` as the payload (you can pass anything you need/want). We will have to alter `Contact.js` to define passing `id` via `payload`.
8. Before heading over to `Contacts.js`, do set a default return incase case `DELETE_CONTACT` doesn't get fired.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

const Context = React.createContext();

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "DELETE_CONTACT":
      return {
        ...state,
        contacts: state.contacts.filter(
          contact => contact.id !== action.payload
        )
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export class Provider extends Component {
  state = {
    contacts: [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: "John Doe",
        email: "jdoe@gmail.com",
        phone: "555-555-5555"
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        name: "Karen Williams",
        email: "karen@gmail.com",
        phone: "222-222-2222"
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        name: "Henry Johnson",
        email: "henry@gmail.com",
        phone: "111-111-1111"
      }
    ]
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <Context.Provider value={this.state}>
        {this.props.children}
      </Context.Provider>
    );
  }
}

export const Consumer = Context.Consumer;
```

<a data="dispatch"></a>

### **_Dispatch_**

We need a way to call an action, which in our case is the `reducer` function. To do this, we need to add what's called a `dispatch` to our state in `context.js`.

1. Under the `contacts` array inside our state in `context.js`, define `dispatch` which will be a function (technically a method).
2. `dispatch` is connected to `reducer` by the second parameter of `reducer`. In our example, `dispatch` equals `action`. Next you have to define what `action` will do.
3. Our action needs to `setState` as per what the `reducer` is defined to do, which in our case is filter out the contact which has the `id` we've specified (which we haven't done yet.)

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

const Context = React.createContext();

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "DELETE_CONTACT":
      return {
        ...state,
        contacts: state.contacts.filter(
          contact => contact.id !== action.payload
        )
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export class Provider extends Component {
  state = {
    contacts: [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: "John Doe",
        email: "jdoe@gmail.com",
        phone: "555-555-5555"
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        name: "Karen Williams",
        email: "karen@gmail.com",
        phone: "222-222-2222"
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        name: "Henry Johnson",
        email: "henry@gmail.com",
        phone: "111-111-1111"
      }
    ],
    dispatch: action => this.setState(state => reducer(state, action))
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <Context.Provider value={this.state}>
        {this.props.children}
      </Context.Provider>
    );
  }
}

export const Consumer = Context.Consumer;
```

<a data="define-payload"></a>

### **_Define Payload_**

Once a `reducer` and `dispatch` have been defined in `context.js`, it's time ensure that `payload` in `reducer` carries the variable and value we intend. In our case, we need to pass the `<Contact />` id in `payload`.

1. Go to `Contact.js` because that's where we have our delete icon.
2. We need to bring in `<Consumer>` to have access to `context.js` where we've defined `state` and our `reducer` method.
3. Once `<Consumer>` has been imported, we need to adjust our `render()` so that we can access that `dispatch` part of the state because that's how we can call our `reducer` action (which is a functon). This is done by wrapping all elements in the `return()` of `render()` inside `<Consumer>`.
4. Before we can paste all the elements currently inside the `return()` of `render()`, we need to specify what we need from `<Consumer>`, which is `dispatch()`. And `dispatch` should be included in `value` since we have passed the entire state via `value` in `context.js`.

```html
<Consumer>
  {value => { }}
</Consumer>
```

5. Value will need to return your values based on what is happening is `<Consumer>`. Therefore, inside the nested curly braces of value, add a `return()`.
6. Inside this `return()` is where to paste in all the `jsx` of the individual contact.
7. The last thing we need to do is update our `onDeleteClick` function, which is still currently empty. We need to connect `onDeleteClick` with `dispatch`.

    - In order to be able to call the dispatch, we have to pass that into `onDeleteClick` as a parameter.
    - In order to do this, we need to `bind()` two things. You will need to bind the `id` to know which contact to delete, as well as `dispatch` to be able to communicate with `reducer` in `context.js`.
    - We will have to pull out `dispatch` from value. Do this with destructuring by creating a `const` under `value`.
    - You will also have to add `id` as a value to your intial destructuring of `this.props.contact` (directly under `render()`).
    - Once you've bound `id` and `dispatch` to `onDeleteClick` in your `onClick` event attached to your `<i>`, you need to add `id` and `dispatch` as parameters to your function definition of `onDeleteClick`.
    - Then inside `onDeleteClick`, call `dispatch()` and pass in the `type` as well as define the `type`. In our case, we need `DELETE_CONTECT`.
    - Inside `dispatch()`, we also need to definte the payload, which is the `id` in this case. So as a second parameter of `dispatch`, add `payload: id`.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import propTypes from "prop-types";
import { Consumer } from "../context";

class Contact extends Component {
  state = {
    showContactInfo: true
  };

  onDeleteClick = (id, dispatch) => {
    dispatch({ type: "DELETE_CONTACT", payload: id });
  };

  render() {
    const { id, name, email, phone } = this.props.contact;
    const { showContactInfo } = this.state;

    return (
      <Consumer>
        {value => {
          const { dispatch } = value;
          return (
            <div className="card card-body mb-3">
              <h4>
                {name}
                <i
                  onClick={() =>
                    this.setState({
                      showContactInfo: !this.state.showContactInfo
                    })
                  }
                  className="fas fa-sort-down"
                  style={{ cursor: "pointer" }}
                />
                <i
                  className="fas fa-times"
                  style={{ cursor: "pointer", float: "right", color: "red" }}
                  onClick={this.onDeleteClick.bind(this, id, dispatch)}
                />
              </h4>
              {showContactInfo ? (
                <ul className="list-group">
                  <li className="list-group-item">Email: {email}</li>
                  <li className="list-group-item">Phone: {phone}</li>
                </ul>
              ) : null}
            </div>
          );
        }}
      </Consumer>
    );
  }
}

Contact.propTypes = {
  contact: propTypes.object.isRequired
};

export default Contact;
```
