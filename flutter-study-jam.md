### **_First Session Sept 16_**

- Everything is an object in Flutter. Margin and padding are objects as well and they have properties. Dart has strict rules for naming variable. All `vars` are considered `const`. 

- For State, use the provider pattern. This uses inherited widget
provider pattern

- A great site for flutter packages is https://pub.dev/flutter
- pub.dev/packages/provider has helloWorld examples

- provider pattern with firebase flutter is highly recommended.

- Run `open -a Simulator` in your terminal while having xcode running to start the iphone emulator.

- To run the emulator in Android Studio, download a device image from AVD Manager and then press the play button.
