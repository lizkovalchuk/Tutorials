# Sun letters

Locally, Damascus is called _ésh-shamam_ (الشام) rather than _Dimashq_ (دمشق). Notice that the first _sh_ in _ésh-shaam_ is acutally written al - ال . In Arabic, "ال" is the definite article, like "the".

"ال" behaves differently when it comes before a word beginning with a "sun letter". The sun letters are"

- ت
- ث
- د
- ذ
- ر
- ز
- س
- ش
- ص
- ض
- ط
- ظ
- ل
- ن

When saying "ال" with words that start with a sun letter, the "ل" disappears. This means _el-shaam_ is pronounced _esh-shaam_. All the other letters are called "moon letters" (except "", which can be either depending on the word and the speaker).
