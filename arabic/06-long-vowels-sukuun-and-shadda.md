# Long vowels

Long vowels have their own letters and are always written. They are:


| Name  | Location | Sound | Exmaples |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| Alif  | ا        | aa    | as is "c<ins>a</ins>t" or "m<ins>aa</ins>m" |
| Yaa   | ي    | ii<br>ee | as in "m<ins>et</ins>t"<br>as in "a<ins>i</ins>r" (without the r) | 
| Waaw  | بُ    | o<br>u | as in "n<ins>o</ins>te"<br>as in "p<ins>u</ins>t" |

> At the end of some words you will see a double _Fatha_ on an _Alif_ اً. This is pronounced as "<ins>an<ins>".

# Sukuun

Sometimes a consonance doesn't carry a vowel. The symbol for this is written above the consonant as a small circle. Like the short vowels, the sukuun is rarely written in Arabic text.
