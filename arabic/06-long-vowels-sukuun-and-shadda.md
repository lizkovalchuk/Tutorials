# Long vowels

Long vowels have their own letters and are always written. They are:


| Name  | Location | Sound | Exmaples |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| Alif  | ا        | aa    | as is "c<ins>a</ins>t" or "m<ins>aa</ins>m" |
| Yaa   | ي    | ii<br>ee | as in "m<ins>et</ins>t"<br>as in "a<ins>i</ins>r" (without the r) | 
| Waaw  | بُ    | o<br>u | as in "n<ins>o</ins>te"<br>as in "p<ins>u</ins>t" |

> At the end of some words you will see a double _Fatha_ on an _Alif_ اً. This is pronounced as "<ins>an<ins>".

# Sukuun

Sometimes a consonance doesn't carry a vowel. The symbol for this is written above the consonant as a small circle. Like the short vowels, the sukuun is rarely written in Arabic text.

- كْتاب

# Shadda

Sometimes a consonant is doubled in length. The symbol for this is like a little "w" above a letter. In transliteration, this is indicated by writing the letter twice. Unlike other symbols, the shedda is usually printed to ensure the meaning of the word is clear. For example, similarly written words can have quite different meaning with a shedda.


| Word  | Meaning | 
|-------|----------|
| درِّسة  | a female teacher |
| درسة | a school        |

> If a consonance carries both a shadda and a kasra, the kasra is not written under the consonance, but under the shadda.
