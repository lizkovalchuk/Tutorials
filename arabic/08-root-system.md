# Root System

All Arabic words are derived from 'roots' which contain the basic meaning of the word. The root is made of three consonants. It  is useful to be able to identify the root of a word because:

- The root of an unfamilar word will often help you to guess its meaning.
- Arabic dictionaries are generally arranged by root, rather than alphabetically.

For example the " ك ت ب " means "write". Here are some words based on this root:

| Arabic | English | 
|--------|----------|
| كياب   | a book |
| كاتب   | a writer |
| مكتب   | an office |
| مكتبة   | a library |
| مكتوب   | a letter |
| بيكتب   | hes write |
| عميكتب   | he is writing |
